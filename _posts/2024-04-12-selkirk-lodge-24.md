Following a wildly successful trip to British Columbia in March of 2023, it didnâ€™t take much convincing to return for another hut week in the Selkirks. After some poking around, we settled on **Selkirk Lodge**, a storied destination with deep snow, rugged terrain, and a well-earned reputation.

## Days 1â€“2: Rogers Pass & Arrival

We left Salt Lake behind with the goal of reaching Rogers Pass before dark. After dodging roadblocks (Tax the Axe!), late-night Tim Hortons, and some very questionable border questioning, we made it.

The next morning, we loaded gear into the heli and were dropped into the remote alpine terrain surrounding Selkirk Lodge.

## Day 3: Storm Day Tree Skiing

Snow rolled in fast overnight. Visibility was limited, but the trees below the hut held cold, soft turns.

## Day 4: Deep Cold Smoke

Bluebird skies and -15Â°C temps greeted us the next morning. It was blower pow from top to bottom.

## Day 5: Exploring the Ridge

We skied steeper lines on the north ridge near the hut, finding great snow preserved by the cold.

## Day 6: Big Tour Day

Our longest day took us out through Lost Valley and back via a high alpine traverse. Massive views and total solitude.

## Day 7: Goodbye, Selkirk Lodge

Our final morning was spent sipping coffee, packing gear, and watching the heli sweep in to carry us back to civilization.
