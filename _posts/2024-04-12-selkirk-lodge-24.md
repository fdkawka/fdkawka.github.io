Following a wildly successful trip to British Columbia in March of 2023, it didn’t take much convincing to return for another hut week in the Selkirks.

### Days 1 & 2 – Arriving at Selkirk Lodge

We passed through a road blockade (Tax the Axe!), questioned the need for 60 beers, and made our way up to Rogers Pass for the night.

After a restful night, we loaded the heli for our drop-off.

We were greeted by warm alpine sun, deep snow, and stunning views. Selkirk Lodge has everything: alpine bowls, pillow lines, tree skiing, and jaw-dropping terrain.

### Day 3 – Storm Skiing

Snow came in strong overnight. Visibility was low, but we scored soft turns in the glades below the lodge.

### Day 4 – Cold Smoke

The storm cleared. -15°C and blower pow. Everyone agreed it was one of the best ski days of their lives.

### Day 5 – Exploring the North Ridge

We skied a few steeper north-facing lines near the upper ridge. Snow stayed soft in the shade.

### Day 6 – The Big Loop

A big touring day covering multiple zones: West Bowl, Lost Valley, and a scenic ridge wrap back to the hut.

### Day 7 – Exit Day

We packed and loaded the heli by mid-morning. Legs were toast but hearts were full.
