Carolyn and I decided to take advantage of a sunny, calm and clear day (rare this season) and pop up to Vail Pass after work to score some evening turns and exercise.

Temps were quite cold, below 10°F, as we got started. The sun was setting, but we figured we could make it out to a less-trafficked zone for some solitude and fresh snow.

We hadn’t really expected or planned for an epic sunset ski, so the energy was high as we continued up. A whole lot of hoops and hollers!

We got to the top and took in the last bits of the sunset, ripped skins, and scored some low-angle powder turns.


With headlamps on and spirits high, we skin-skied back to the cars while temps dropped below zero.
