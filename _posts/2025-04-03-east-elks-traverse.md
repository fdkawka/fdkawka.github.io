Linking together a multi-day hut-to-hut traverse in the Alfred A. Braun & Friends’ Hut System has been a goal of mine...

*Tagert Hut approach*

### Day 1 – Tagert Hut Approach

The storm dropped just enough snow to freshen the skiing without increasing avalanche danger. We approached from Ashcroft up Castle Creek Road...

### Day 2 – Pearl Pass to Friends' Hut

> “We passed through the Mace Saddle and looked back at Castle and Conundrum peaks...”

### Day 3 – Powder Skiing Near Star Peak

* The June Couloir was too exposed, so we found dry powder on NE-facing slopes below the ridge.

*A proper powder party!*

### Day 4 – Star Pass to Opa’s Taylor Hut

After a windy climb to Star Pass, we descended toward the Taylor River...

### Day 5 – Back to Ashcroft

Skied back out via Little Italian Pass, followed Express Creek down to Ashcroft.

**Total: ~31 miles and nearly 11,000 ft of gain.**  
Huge thanks to the crew. This was a dream trip years in the making!
